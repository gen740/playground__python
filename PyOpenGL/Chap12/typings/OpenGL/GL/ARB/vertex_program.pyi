'''OpenGL extension ARB.vertex_program

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.ARB.vertex_program to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	Unextended OpenGL mandates a certain set of configurable per-vertex
	computations defining vertex transformation, texture coordinate generation
	and transformation, and lighting.  Several extensions have added further
	per-vertex computations to OpenGL.  For example, extensions have defined
	new texture coordinate generation modes (ARB_texture_cube_map,
	NV_texgen_reflection, NV_texgen_emboss), new vertex transformation modes
	(ARB_vertex_blend, EXT_vertex_weighting), new lighting modes (OpenGL 1.2's
	separate specular and rescale normal functionality), several modes for fog
	distance generation (NV_fog_distance), and eye-distance point size
	attenuation (EXT/ARB_point_parameters).
	
	Each such extension adds a small set of relatively inflexible
	per-vertex computations.
	
	This inflexibility is in contrast to the typical flexibility provided by
	the underlying programmable floating point engines (whether micro-coded
	vertex engines, DSPs, or CPUs) that are traditionally used to implement
	OpenGL's per-vertex computations.  The purpose of this extension is to
	expose to the OpenGL application writer a significant degree of per-vertex
	programmability for computing vertex parameters.
	
	For the purposes of discussing this extension, a vertex program is a
	sequence of floating-point 4-component vector operations that determines
	how a set of program parameters (defined outside of OpenGL's Begin/End
	pair) and an input set of per-vertex parameters are transformed to a set
	of per-vertex result parameters.
	
	The per-vertex computations for standard OpenGL given a particular set of
	lighting and texture coordinate generation modes (along with any state for
	extensions defining per-vertex computations) is, in essence, a vertex
	program.  However, the sequence of operations is defined implicitly by the
	current OpenGL state settings rather than defined explicitly as a sequence
	of instructions.
	
	This extension provides an explicit mechanism for defining vertex program
	instruction sequences for application-defined vertex programs.  In order
	to define such vertex programs, this extension defines a vertex
	programming model including a floating-point 4-component vector
	instruction set and a relatively large set of floating-point 4-component
	registers.
	
	The extension's vertex programming model is designed for efficient
	hardware implementation and to support a wide variety of vertex programs.
	By design, the entire set of existing vertex programs defined by existing
	OpenGL per-vertex computation extensions can be implemented using the
	extension's vertex programming model.
