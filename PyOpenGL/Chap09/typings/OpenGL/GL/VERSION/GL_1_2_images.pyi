"""Version 1.2 Image-handling functions

Almost all of the 1.2 enhancements are image-handling-related,
so this is, most of the 1.2 wrapper code...

Note that the functions that manually wrap certain operations are
guarded by if simple.functionName checks, so that you can use
if functionName to see if the function is available at run-time.
